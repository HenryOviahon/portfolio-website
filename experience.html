    <h1>Experience</h1>

    <p>My first experience with Python was with creating programs in high school in a course. It was a basic rundown on how to use IDLE and program using that text editor in particular. It taught me the foundations and essentials of programming languages, and how to procedurally code software. I had this knowledge renewed after studying a computer science course during my time in my Bachelor's degree.</p>
    <p>When it comes to Java, I first learned of it through being taught how to use it in high school as well. I grew much more as a java programmer once I studied it in university, gaining a greater in depth understanding of the programming language. I was able to engage in object oriented programming and learn about polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.</p>
    <p>Being in a university in general has made me learn many more theoretical aspects surrounding the discipline of programming.</p>
