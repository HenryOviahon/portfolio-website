      <p>My first experience with Python was with creating programs in high school in a course. It was a basic rundown on how to use IDLE and program using that text editor in particular. It taught me the foundations and essentials of programming languages, and how to procedurally code software. I had this knowledge renewed after studying a computer science course during my time in my Bachelor's degree. I've also done object oriented programming on languages similar to Python before.</p>
      <p>When it comes to Java, I first learned of it through being taught how to use it in high school as well. I grew much more as a Java programmer once I studied it in university, gaining a greater in depth understanding of the programming language. I was able to engage in object oriented programming and learn about polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. Inheritance is creating objects that inherit functionality from its parent class, Polymorphism is using a single interface for multiple different types. Encapsulation is the combination of information into a single class, and abstraction is hiding any information that is unnecessary from others. </p>
      <p>Being in a university in general has made me learn many more theoretical aspects surrounding the discipline of programming. I've learned a lot about matrices, logic, philosophy, and other things as well. On my own time, I strive to program daily and to constantly keep my skills sharp. I will keep trying to learn more programming languages, first starting with C# and then other languages. My degree program will likely allow me to be able to learn more in the process, as well.</p>  
      <p>When I first started programming, I found myself getting stuck quite often on problems I could not resolve. Nowadays however, it is less frequent and I am more used to approaching coding problems with the right mindset to be able to resolve them. I've also noticed with time that a lot of programming languages are similar in that most knowledge learned is able to be transferred to the others in some shape or form. Of course, this isn't universal and some are incomparable, but the fundamental core of knowledge once built up can be applied to any language after learning the syntax.</p>
