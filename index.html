    <h1>Henry Oviahon</h1>

    <p>Hello, I am from Calgary, Alberta, and I am currently a student learning how to build software as well as the soft skills surrounding the discipline. So far, I have developed experience with the languages of Python and Java, as well as a small amount of HTML. I currently am practice my skills with CSS.</p>
    <p>Presently, I am working on finding ways to create more projects to demonstrate my experience with programming and open source projects I could contribute to. I currently have plans to learn basic skills for web development as well as Android development.</p>
    <p>I am striving to work hard and to improve myself. At this point in time, I am currently trying to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript through a course.</p>
