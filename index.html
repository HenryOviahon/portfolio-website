    <h1>Henry Oviahon</h1>

    <p>Hello, I am from Calgary, Alberta, and I am currently a student learning how to build software as well as the soft skills surrounding the discipline. So far, I have developed experience with the languages of Python and Java, as well as a small amount of HTML. I currently am practice my skills with web development.</p>
    <p>Presently, I am working on finding ways to create more projects to demonstrate my experience with programming and open source projects I could contribute to. I currently have plans to learn basic skills for web development as well as Android development.</p>
    <p>I am striving to work hard and to improve myself.</p>

      <p> Use &lt; and &gt; to use greater than and lesser than signs in html and &amp; for and sign. Use &copy; for copyright symbol</p>
      <p> Use &nbsp for non breaking space to cause a larger block of text to word wrap. </p>
      <p> html entities are for avoiding rendering issues, helping with more limited character encoding,
        and providing characters not avaliable on a keyboard. The stuff listed above few lines are html entities. </p>
